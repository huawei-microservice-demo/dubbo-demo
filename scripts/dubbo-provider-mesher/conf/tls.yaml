## Mesher TLS is base on Go Chassis TLS config
## If users wan't to use transparent, ssl config for consumer and provider must be supplied.
#ssl:
## The provider is the service which run in the same host/pod with mesher. for example the service name of provider is AccountService, then the ssl tag is AccountService.rest.provider
## if u set this , no need to consider about expose your own service as https service,
## your service can only listen on 127.0.0.1, mesher wil expose https and use http to communicate with your service
#  AccountService.provider.cipherPlugin: default
#  AccountService.provider.verifyPeer: false
#  AccountService.provider.cipherSuits: TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256,TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384
#  AccountService.provider.protocol: TLSv1.2
#  AccountService.provider.caFile:
#  AccountService.provider.certFile:
#  AccountService.provider.keyFile:
#  AccountService.provider.certPwdFile:
## If a service want to use transparent tls to call other services, it must supplies consumer ssl config for these services.
## for example StoreWeb want to communicate with Account service the  config is like below
#  AccountService.consumer.cipherPlugin: default
#  AccountService.consumer.verifyPeer: false
#  AccountService.consumer.cipherSuits: TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256,TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384
#  AccountService.consumer.protocol: TLSv1.2
#  AccountService.consumer.caFile:
#  AccountService.consumer.certFile:
#  AccountService.consumer.keyFile:
#  AccountService.consumer.certPwdFile:
